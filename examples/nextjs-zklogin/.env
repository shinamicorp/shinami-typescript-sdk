# OAuth application configs. Configure the ones you want to support. They'll serve as both the auth
# mechanism for this app and transaction signing mechanism (zkLogin). Note that if you have multiple
# providers configured, the same person will be considered a different user for each provider they
# log in with (with different zkLogin wallets), even if they may share the same email.
#
# Refer to this link for instructions on setting up these OAuth applications:
